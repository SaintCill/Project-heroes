# Book of Heroes

**The Book of Heroes** is a website meant to celebrate the many heroes throughout history that mainstream media often forgets. The website seeks to not only educate about many important figures that are often forgotten about, but also to tell the reader a good story. The website is designed with simplicity in mind as its focus is on the content itself.

This design was chosen after alot of back and forth regarding how i should present such an important topic as people's stories. A quote from Hans Hofman helped me decide.
>To simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary, so that the necessary may speak - Hans Hofman
