# Book of Heroes

**The Book of Heroes** is a website meant to celebrate the many heroes throughout history that mainstream media often forgets. The website seeks to not only educate about many important figures that are often forgotten about, but also to tell the reader a good story. The website is designed with simplicity in mind as its focus is on the content itself.

This design was chosen after alot of back and forth regarding how i should present such an important topic as people's stories. A quote from Hans Hofman helped me decide.
>To simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary, so that the necessary may speak - Hans Hofman

# Testing

Website has been tested and deployed on both replit and github, aswell as tested for performance and feature function on Opera GX, Google Chrome, Edge and Firefox. The website was also tested on older versions of internet explorer running on older OS with the help of https://www.browserling.com/. I also ran additional lighthouse test through https://pagespeed.web.dev and performance test through https://www.webpagetest.org.
Project was also put through several screen sizes without visible bugs or performance drop.

W3C HTML Validator and jigsaw was used prior to deployment aswell as during deployment to find any unnecessary code and remove or change it. Currently code comes back clean if ran through any of those tests.
