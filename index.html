        <h3>to the Book of Heroes!</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the book of heroes! The purpose of this website is to bring those heroes that are forgotten in todays mainstream to the forefront. Extraordinary individuals from a bygone age that went above and beyond. This website seeks to celebrate these forgotten Heroes and tell you their stories. Everyone from WW2 spies to old tall tales of vikings!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note that while we will be including such stories as the viking who held of Harold Godwinson's army at the stamfort bridge, we do recognise that such stories are likely exagerations of what actually went down. When talking about stories from hundreds of years ago it is difficult to accertain exactly what is fact, and what is someone exagerating parts of the story to tell a good myth. Perhaps the story remains 100% true but the act or the individual makes it seem like fiction. Therefore when talking about such individuals we have made sure to do our best to seperate myth from man, aswell as included several of the most popular theories of what actually went down. Speculations and theories on the truth of the events have been seperated from the stories themselves, for those that don't wish "spoil" the story.</p>
